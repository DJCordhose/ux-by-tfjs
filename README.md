## What makes this hard?

This is specific to how my input device works (this does not work for touch)
- using trackpad
- windows / mac / linux
- using mouse
- speed of input device

And personal style
- beginner / expert
- fast / slow
- direct / curvy

## Possible improvements / next steps

* collect and store raw path data
  * decide what makes sense later, be more flexible
* split path to aim into fragments
  * better prediction: each good for prediction in different parts of the path
  * more training data
